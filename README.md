This is my submission for Gitcoin's [Schelling Point Virtual Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/schellingpoint)

[**Task 2 - Great CyberConnected DApp**](https://gitcoin.co/issue/cyberconnecthq/explorer-and-cyberconnected-dapps/2/100027518)&#x20;

This blockchain explorer application is built with react and utilizes the CyberConnect GraphQL API to create a social experience. It features prominent recommended profiles, and users can search for different address profile's to view followers, followings and account information.  Create Posts, Follow and Send tips directly to your friends!
